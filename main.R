##---RUNNING NZ's FEWS PACKAGE ON NAMIBIA DATA---##

#1. You can use this script after you have run the "Run_Once.R" script once.

#2. This script will read data in the same format as was shared by Elijah with UNSD.
    # If the format changes, this script may not work.

#3. More instructions and comments within the script

##-----------------------------------------------##

# **Save everything (data, this script, other scripts) in one folder
  # Following command will set the working directory same as where this script is saved

setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))

# **Load package "dplyr" for data manipulation

library(dplyr)

# **Load package "FEWS" for Indices calculation

library(FEWS)

# **Create a "notin" operator

"%notin%" <- Negate("%in%")

# **Read Namibia data for 2016-2020
